# What is Design Thinking?

--
+ A repeatable process employing unique and creative techniques ([Source](http://www.fastcompany.com/919258/design-thinking-what))

--
+ A formal method for practical, creative resolution of problems and creation of solutions, with the intent of an improved future result ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking))

> What we, as design thinkers, have, is this creative confidence that, when given a difficult problem, we have a methodology that enables us to come up with a solution that nobody has before.
